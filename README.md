# ML Reading Group

This repository is devoted to Machine Learning reading group held in Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, [Transilvania University of Brasov](http://www.unitv.ro/).

Weekely meetings are scheduled in **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Iuliu Maniu 50, room PIII1 or PIII4, every Wednesday, 18-19.30**, officially starting with October 31st. A [first lecture](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~niyogi/papersps/BNMLJ.pdf) was delivered by Alexandru Ionescu, Ph.D., on October 24th. 

Some weeks are for presenting and discussing research papers, and the other weeks are for discussing selected books chapters. We start with [Duda *et al.* book](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Classification-Pt-1-Richard-Duda/dp/0471056693/), with [errata](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~bebis/CS479/Handouts/Errata.pdf). 

Ph.D. students, researchers and interested people are expected to actively participate to these meetings.
